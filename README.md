# Pomodoro Timer Project

The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool developed using Python's Tkinter module, designed to help users manage their work and break intervals effectively. This application is based on the Pomodoro Technique, which encourages focused work sessions followed by short breaks to enhance concentration and prevent burnout.

**##Project Description**

The timer features an intuitive graphical interface, making it easy to start, pause, and reset the timer.

Users can set their desired work duration (typically 25 minutes) and break duration (usually 5 minutes) and long break of (20 minutes) according to their preferences.

When the timer completes a session, users receive visual check marks to signal the end of work or break periods.

It can track the number of completed Pomodoros, providing users with a sense of accomplishment and helping them monitor their productivity over time.

**##Implementation**

Tkinter Library: Utilized to create the GUI components, such as buttons, labels, and the main window.

Time Management: The time module manages countdowns, while threading is used to keep the UI responsive during timer sessions.
